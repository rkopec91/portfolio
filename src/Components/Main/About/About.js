      <p>
      I completed my Bachelor’s of Science Mechanical Engineering and received a minor in electrical engineering at Drexel University. Currently I am attending Georgia Institute of Technology for my Master’s in Computer Science with a specialization in machine learning/computer vision.  I am very interested in machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, web development, and software engineering.

      As a student at Georgia Tech, Drexel University, and Burlington County College I had the chance to explore many different projects and classes that gave me a wide range of experience.  I took controls classes, math classes, thermodynamic classes, fluids classes, Computer Vision classes, Machine Learning classes and electrical engineering classes.  I enjoy writing code.  In my free time I develop a wide range of projects such as android applications, video games, artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning models, and anything that will challenge my software development skills.  One of my favorite languages to develop in is Python, however, I am not limited to just that language.  For example, I have experience in C++, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and React.  My goal is to learn something new every day.

      My work experience includes Lockheed Martin, Slyce, Georgia Tech, and CVision AI.  I have had many different roles such as data analyst, software engineer, graduate teaching assistant, scrum master, and senior algorithm developer. Currently, I am teach tennis to people ranging from children to adults for the Burlington County Tennis Association.  I thoroughly enjoy helping people improve their tennis skills and working with such a diverse group of individuals.  Currently, I am open to new opportunities and am actively looking for a position in software engineering or machine learning.
