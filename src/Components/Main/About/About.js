      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I studied mechanical engineering and received a minor in electrical engineering at Drexel University. Currently I am attending Georgia Institute of Technology for my masters in computer science with a specialization in machine learning/ artificial intelligence/ computer vision. I am very interested in machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and software engineering. I have an Associates degree in engineering from Burlington County College.

        As a student at Georgia Tech, Drexel University, and Burlington County College, I had the chance to explore many different projects and classes that gave me a wide range of experience. I took controls classes, math classes, thermodynamic classes, fluids classes, Computer Vision classes, Machine Learning classes and electrical engineering classes. I enjoy coding. On my free time I develop android applications, video games, artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning models and anything that will challenge my software development skills. One of my favorite languages to develop in is Python but I am not limited to just that. I try to learn as many languages as I can to expand my skill set.

        I worked at Lockheed Martin for 4 years. Currently, I am working as a Software engineer at Slyce visual search and a graduate teaching assistant at Georgia Tech. I also sometimes work in the maintenance department at Saint Joan of Arc School/Church. We do different tasks at Saint Joan of Arc from landscaping to repair work. Saint Joan of Arc gave me experience in a lot of different areas such as repair work using a large variety of tools, landscape work, and collaborating with a team of 8 to 10 coworkers. I also teach tennis to people ranging from children at age 5 to adults for the Burlington County Tennis Association. I evaluate student performance and technique and formulate different solutions to studentsâ€™ problems.
